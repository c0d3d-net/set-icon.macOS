data.install
-

This file contains raw data that is not easy to read using a text editor like NotePad or Atom. You may have noticed, too, that there are other files in this folder. They are the the editions (to my knowledge) of `data.install` that have been renamed to become a `.zip` file, then unzipped/extracted. From this point, they are viewed using different methods. If there is any overlooked data I have not been able to get to, please bring it to light. Once/If we find everything, we can finally implement it into the shell script to be written & activated on detection, making it our final product!
